The RED Screen Editor for BDS C v1.6
------------------------------------

Edward K. Ream has modifed his RED screen editor to interact with the new
BDS C v1.6 error diagnostic mechanism. When the CC option "-w" is specified,
or if the RED output option has been chosen through use of the new BDS C CONFIG
program (not to be confused with the RED CONFIG!), then a special error file
called PROGERRS.$$$ containing compilation error messages is written by the
compiler. If RED is then invoked, it will see PROGERRS.$$$ and use it as a
guide to pinpoint and diagnose errors in the erroneous source file.

------------------------------------
Edward Ream's notes:


With ERR_CMND NOT defined, there are exactly 255 functions in the link. This
makes it  possible to link red with CLINK.COM. If you add any more functions,
or define ERR_CMND, then RED will contain more than 255 functions and you can
only use L2 to link it.

The additions to RED that the user will notice (above and beyond original
RED capabilities as outlined in the .DOC files) are as follows:

If the file PROGERRS.$$$ (generated by CC.COM under the appropriate conditions)
exists when RED is entered, it will print a message on the prompt line. Hit
any character to continue.

If the file PROGERRS.$$$ exists and no file was specified on the command line, 
RED will automatically load the file named on the first line of the 
PROGERRS.$$$ file.  Otherwise, the file named on the command line is loaded.

Pressing > in edit mode (or ESC > in other modes) displays the error message
of the next line of the error file on the command line.  Hit any key to move
to the offending line.

Pressing < in edit mode (or ESC < in other modes) displays the previous error 
message and move to that line after any key is pressed.

RED knows enough to ignore error lines in PROGERRS.$$$ that do not pertain to
the file being edited.  However, you can fool RED if you change the current 
files name using the "name" command.

RED knows enough (I think) to adjust line numbers properly for inserting, 
deleting, moving and copying lines, though there may be a minor bug here 
lurking.

The "cc" command has been added.  This will automatically exit RED and will 
invoke CC <filename> where <filename> is the name shown on the command line.
At present there are no provisions for additional arguments to CC.

If enabled (which it is NOT at present to get under 255 functions) the
"errors" command will list the first 20 or so (depending on screen size)
lines of the PROGERRS.$$$ file.
